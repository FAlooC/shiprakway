                        During the manufacturing cycle of a PET product, it goes through various stages before it is
                        ready to be sold in a commercial form. Among these multiple stages, a few are generally
                        overlooked. A detailed study reveals that because of this, the actual manufacturing cost is much
                        more than what was initially projected. This underestimation leads to higher budgeted
                        expenditure for the particular product.
